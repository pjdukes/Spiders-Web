!!!Developers MUST include *Test.java in the filename for tests!!!
Java Source Files: "src/main/java/*"
Java Test Files: "src/main/java/*"
Compiled .class Source Output Files: "build/main/*"
Compiled .class Test Output Files: "build/test/*"
Jar Outputs: "build/jar/*", "build/jar/spidersweb/*"

I think, at least. Will be revised if needed.

Run command "ant" on root directory (Spiders-Web) for compilation and testing.
